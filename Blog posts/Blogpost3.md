<H2> Description <H2>

In this update, we have added a skybox to the dimension inside of the portal so that the AR environment to not collide with real-life elements. We've also added a 3D text box that will automatically pop up when the device is looking directly at an object that has that property. A 2D alternative was also implemented so that when the user taps on a specific object, a description of that object will be displayed. For a more vibrant and engaging experience, we've also added some background music to fit with each environment.
