## Description ##

In this update, we've made some improvements to the placement marker and fixed some clipping issues while transitioning from the real world to the inside of a portal. To make the experience more pleasant, we have added an interface before entering the app and we have properly built the portal environments to create an immersive experience.


## Marker ##

## App UI (Andrei) ##  

The UI of the application consists of 3 buttons that resemble 3 different historic places: Leonardo da Vinci's pieces of art, the Vikings era, and the Mesozoic era.

Upon pressing one of these 3 buttons, the specific era portal will appear. Only one portal can be placed at a time. Upon placing another portal, the old one will disappear.

## History locations environments (Andrei / Emanuel / Oriana) ##

### Mesozoic era (Andrei) ###

The Mesozoic era is known as the "Age of Reptiles" marking the existence of different types of dinosaurs. Especially for children, this topic is always an interesting one, and since it is hard to resemble how they exactly look or the color of their skin, the existence of them can not be denied. In this environment 3 dinosaur species were covered: Stegasaurus, Velociraptor, and Pachycephalasaurus, each of them having a description of the species that they belong to, upton tapping on them.
