<H2> Description <H2>

In this update, we've made some improvements to the placement marker and fixed some clipping issues while transitioning from the real world to the inside of a portal. To make the experience more pleasant, we have added an interface before entering the app and we have properly built the portal environments to create an immersive experience.
